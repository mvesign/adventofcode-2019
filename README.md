# Advent Of Code - 2019

Yet another year, and another promise to not finish this. But h√©, you got to keep trying... Right? Lets find out!

## Structure

So like the previous years, each day part is present in a separate directory with it's own files.

## Check solution of the day.

To check the solution of each day part, you'll need the latest .NET Core version with C# 8.0 or higher. After that, it's an easy 1-2-3 step in order to get the solution of each day part.

### 1. Go to the directory of the day part.
```
cd C:\Projects\GitHub\adventofcode-2019\day-1-1
```

### 2. Build the project.
```
dotnet build
```

### 3. Execute the solution.
```
dotnet run
```
